# Deep_learing-Cancer-detection-alexnet-and-google-net

This is my First Deep Learning Project, it consists of classification of various types of cancers based on the images given. My dataset primarily consists of 9 classes
and all the files of those classes are attached in this repo. I used CNN algorithms like AlexNet and GoogleNet in order to implement this project. After training the model
we can validate our model by uploading various images of the predefined classes inorder to check accuracy.

**Thank You**
